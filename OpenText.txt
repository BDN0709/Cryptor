Doctor Klein: Good morning, Cecilia, how are you feeling today?
Cecilia: I do not feel very well, Doctor Klein.
I hope that you can treat my illness.
Doctor Klein: I am sorry that you feel very sick. Tell me some
of your symptoms so that I can give you a proper diagnosis.
Cecilia: I have not felt well since yesterday afternoon.
The symptoms began with a headache and a gradual sore throat.
I drank tea with lemon and honey, and I went to bed early.
However, I am extremely exhausted, and I do not feel any better today.
Doctor Klein: I have seen these symptoms recently in some of my other patients.
I will check your temperature and examine your throat
in order to give you a proper diagnosis.
Cecilia: Thank you, Doctor.
